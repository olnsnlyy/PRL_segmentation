# 🧠 Automated PRL Segmentation in Multiple Sclerosis using QSM
### Deep Learning-based Paramagnetic Rim Lesion Segmentation

Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are imaging biomarkers of chronic active lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). 
This repository provides an automated deep learning tool for detecting and segmenting PRLs on QSM images.
